# Introduction
OpenUO should be considered a child project of the [ClassicUO](https://github.com/ClassicUO/ClassicUO) repository, we will continue to receive updates and ClassicUO is more than welcome to take any of our features. 

With the difference in vision of providing an experience which surpass the features offered by the original game client. 

New features will be able to detected through custom packets and file formats, but all features must be optional and be turned off by default, and original functionality in place.

Features such as custom file formats **must** be detected through client side detection of the custom formats.

Features added through custom packets **must** be enabled or disabled through a handshake with the server.

PRs will only be accepted if they come along with a PR on one of the accepted emulators. The emulator side PR must include basic functionality to operator your new feature. It will not require your full implementation as there is a reasonable expection that server side code is private.

The client is currently under heavy development but is functional. The code is based on the [FNA-XNA](https://fna-xna.github.io/) framework. C# is chosen because there is a large community of developers working on Ultima Online server emulators in C#, because FNA-XNA exists and seems reasonably suitable for creating this type of game.


OpenUO is natively cross platform and supports:
* Browser [Chrome]
* Windows [DirectX 11, OpenGL, Vulkan]
